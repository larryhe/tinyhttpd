To build:

    % ./configure

    Edit config.h to change the configuration options if necessary.

    % make


To install:

    % make install

    Edit one of your system rc files to run thttpd at boot time.  Do NOT
    run it from inetd, that setup is inefficient so thttpd doesn't support it.


Red Hat:

    On Red Hat Linux systems you can use RPM to install thttpd, like so:

	cd /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
	wget http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/thttpd-2.25b.tar.gz
	rpm -ta thttpd-2.25b.tar.gz
	rpm -i /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/thttpd-2.25b-1.i386.rpm


Solaris:

    If you're running Solaris and you want to use the security-enhancing
    chroot feature, then you must create the TCP device files in the chroot
    tree.  There is no way around this, Solaris needs these files to accept
    network connections.  You need /dev/tcp, which is a symbolic link like so:
	/dev/tcp -> ../devices/pseudo/clone@0:tcp
    And you also need the file it points to:
	crw-rw-rw-  bin  11, 42 May 24 21:32 /devices/pseudo/clone@0:tcp
    You probably need some other files too, such as shared libraries and
    a tmp directory.  Check out the man page for ftpd, it has a big long
    shell script for setting up an anonymous ftp area that should also
    work for thttpd.
